### Demonstration of Games

"Brain Games" is a set of five console games based on popular mobile apps for brain training. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered completed. Incorrect answers end the game and prompt you to play it again.
Games:

brain-calc. Arithmetic expressions that need to be calculated
brain-progression. Finding missing numbers in a sequence of numbers
brain-even. Determining an even number
brain-gcd. Determining the greatest common divisor
brain-prime. Determining a prime number
